# C4 Corn Theory

## Intro
Karl was good at hacking at all things software and hardware.  But he was bored with himself and school.  On a whim, he decided to apply to the CIA.   The CIA didn’t hesitate to hire Karl.

Karl was excited to be in the CIA.  The next day, at 3am, he boarded a flight on dusty and rather worn military transport which was suppose to take him to The Farm -- CIA’s famous training base in Virginia.   Mid flight, Karl was pushed out of the plane with nothing more than self opening parachute on his back, into the darkness of the night. 

Karl landed just outside a of town.  Karl didn’t know if this was where he was supposed to be.  Was this part of the training or something else?  Karl was about to find out.
